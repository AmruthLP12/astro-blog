# Welcome to My Astro Blog 👋

Hello world! I'm excited to share my journey with **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern web development. This blog will be a space to experiment, learn, and document everything I build along the way.

## Why I Chose Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that lets you:

- Write components using **React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML**.
- Deliver **blazing-fast performance** because it ships only the necessary JavaScript.
- Easily integrate **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- Use **Markdown** for content, making it simple to write and maintain blog posts.

I love how Astro lets me **focus on content first** while keeping the front-end modern.
